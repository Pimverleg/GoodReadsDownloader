# GoodReadsDownloader
This script will use a goodreads export to generare piratebay links to the books you might want to download.

## usage.
1. log in to your gooreads account 
2. navigate to https://www.goodreads.com/review/import
3. download your goodreads export file
4. place the csv in the same folder as the main script
5. run the main script

output:
a print of each url

## already working.
each book read or unread will generate a piratebay url. some urls show a page with no results.

## will be added soon
1. add code so only books with atleast one result are shown
2. add fuctionality to auto download a selection.


##  tip.
add older books to your goodreads that are public domain. these are in many cases legal to download
